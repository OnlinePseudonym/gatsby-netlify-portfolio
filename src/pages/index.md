      Cute place but food was mediocre and needed salt badly. Wait staff were
      attentive and friendly. Bar area was cluttered and had too much going on
      to be relaxing. Recommendation: Put the server station on the other side.

      This place is actually really good, I gave it one star  I am trying to
      make these pizza ratings more realistic and Rosatis and Venezia's have the
      best pizza and for some reason they are rated lower than they should
      be-probabblly because they are more expensive and cheap people get angry
      about that but Rosatis and Venezia's are the best, Grimaldis is also
      really good but they don't deliver, I really like Florencia though- its my
      favorite pizza restaurant in Ahwatukee to eat at, but for delivery I go
      with Rosatis.
